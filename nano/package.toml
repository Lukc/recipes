GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
(itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).

However, nano also implements many features missing in pico, including:
	- feature toggles;
	- interactive search and replace (with regular expression support);
	- go to line (and column) command;
	- auto-indentation and color syntax-highlighting;
	- filename tab-completion and support for multiple buffers;
	- full internationalization support.
